# ElectricityConsumption
Hello judges good afternoon

# Approach
We intend to use GBMs(Gradient Boosting Machines) neural networks to better forecast energy requirements in the union territory of Delhi.

According to the few papers we read GBMs provide a better approximation of the load on electricity grid on a given day as opposed to ARIMA(Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) which is widely used for similar problems such as prediction of natural gas demand and conventional RNNs to a smaller extent. 


# Refrences
- [Electricity consumption data](https://report.grid-india.in/index.php?p=Daily+Report%2FPSP+Report) has been sourced from [Grid Controller Of India(formerly POSOCO)](https://posoco.in).
- Weather data has been sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data) and many more sources to have the most complete collection.
- A [paper](/refrences/paper_submitted.pdf) published by **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory** has been refrenced in research for this project.
