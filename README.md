# ElectricityConsumption
Hello judges good afternoon

# Approach
We intend to use GBMs(Gradient Boosting Machines) neural networks to better forecast energy requirements in the union territory of Delhi.

According to the few papers we read GBMs provide a better approximation of the load on electricity grid on a given day as opposed to ARIMA(Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) which is widely used for similar problems such as prediction of natural gas demand and conventional RNNs to a smaller extent. 

Although there is a lot of work left we hope this is a good enough representation of what's to come.
